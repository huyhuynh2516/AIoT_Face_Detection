# AIoT Face Detection System – ESP32-CAM + Blynk
A smart AIoT surveillance system using ESP32-CAM that can detect motion and human faces, capture an image, and send it to the Blynk IoT App in real-time.  
This project demonstrates embedded programming, IoT communication, image processing, and cloud integration.

# Features
Motion Detection using PIR sensor  
Face Detection using ESP32-CAM built-in AI model  
Capture JPEG images when motion/face is detected  
Encode images to Base64 & upload to **Blynk Cloud** via HTTP API  
View snapshots directly in the Blynk mobile app (Image Widget)  
Log detection events with real-time timestamps  
Remotely enable/disable image capturing and adjust PIR sensitivity
